# file_sharing_app

A file-sharing system built with Flutter using MongoDB to store shared files. This app allows you to upload files from your computer and view them within the app. If all users are connected to the database, they can see any file uploaded by any user within the app. You can also view images and text files.  

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following:
* Flutter JDK: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
* Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
* Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
* MongoDB Account: https://www.mongodb.com/

## How to Run our App
1. Create a new flutter project
2. Replace the 'pubspec.yaml' file with ours
3. Type 'pub spec get' into the terminal to update dependencies
4. Add our 'main.dart' and 'constant.dart' source files to the 'lib' folder in your new flutter project
     * Create a new MongoDB project and replace your link with the one in constant.dart to connect to your database along with your collection.
     * Refer to this video for more information [Connect Flutter with MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpYATokJiSE)
6. Add the Image Folder to the flutter project
7. Save all files.
8. In your terminal within VS Code type in 'flutter run'
9. If you are getting errors, type 'flutter doctor' and follow the instructions
10. Choose a device to display the app. (We used Windows)
